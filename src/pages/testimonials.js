          …two words qualify Apollo Interiors…..‘Serious Professionals’ From the
          beginning of our dental practice project, right to the end, we were
          given full attention in ensuring that the project was carried out
          according to our desires. They even tolerated the minor changes we
          requested during the project. We were duly informed at every stage.
          The quality of the finish and the time scale to deliver were
          impressive. The honesty & transparency in their pricing was
          particularly helpful, just like the brilliant ideas offered by the
          Project Designer, Chris P. The compendium of important information and
          contact numbers presented to us at the end of the project and covering
          every aspect of the fit-out works was very useful and reassuring
          indeed. Whereas most building companies will ‘disappear’ as soon as
          the project is done, Apollo Interiors have given their assurance that
          they will be reviewing the project 3 months post-completion to see if
          any remedial works need to be carried out. That’s very reassuring!! In
          my opinion, two words qualify Apollo Interiors…..‘Serious
          Professionals’ A special thanks to the company director Chris A and,
          the project designer Chris P, for their unwavering support right from
          the beginning and throughout the project.

          We would not hesitate to recommend [Apollo] to others, and we have!
          “We are extremely happy with Apollo’s services, they have transformed
          our old traditional building into a modern state of art facility which
          is fully compliant to HTM 0105 and DDA requirements. Our practice is
          now both inviting and visually stimulating and patients are amazement
          at the transformation. Their planning was meticulous and well thought
          out. They worked very hard to conform to our strict deadlines ensuring
          minimum disruption at all times. We would not hesitate to recommend
          them to others, and we have!”

          I would highly recommend Apollo to any prospective clients “I am very
          pleased to say the whole experience was phenomenal! In my opinion, the
          whole team was extraordinary – a brilliant and very professional
          service. The best quality of Apollo design and build contractors is
          their flexibility & the degree of co-operation throughout the project.
          They were very caring and know the dental industry very well. The
          quality of materials and workmanship was A1. I would highly recommend
          Apollo to any prospective clients.”

          …specialist expertise and skilled working “I am particularly proud of
          how this refurbishment has transformed two floors of an empty office
          block into a stylish purposeful service unit and have no doubt that
          this transformation has been achieved by the specialist expertise and
          skilled working brought to this project by Apollo.”

        <p>
          Apollo lived up to their reputation “We employed Apollo Interiors Ltd
          to carry out an extensive building project in Hampstead. The project
          consisted of converting two 2nd floor apartments into two split level
          apartments by converting the loft space. It required a very high level
          of building expertise and the finishes had to be of a very high
          quality. I am pleased to say that Apollo lived up to their reputation
          – the works were seamless, finished to a high quality, completed on
          time and on budget. I am currently working with Apollo specialist
          design and build contractors on new projects and look forward to a
          long working relationship.”

          …the end result is fabulous! “Apollo carried out a signiﬁcant
          refurbishment of our practice in 2011. The refurbishment contractors
          were organised and efﬁcient and the end result is fabulous! They have
          created a wonderful environment in which to work and we receive
          compliments from our patients almost every day! I would not hesitate
          to use their services again.”

          The standard of workmanship is excellent “Clive and I just want to say
          how pleased we are with our new surgery, and with the great job done
          especially by John and the team. Every detail has been taken care of
          meticulously, and we are most grateful to you all for the many hours
          worked to deliver a perfect result. The standard of workmanship is
          excellent, and we would be happy to recommend you as specialist design
          and build contractors at any time.”

          [Apollo] were absolutely amazing “We were struggling to find a design
          and build contractor who could advise us on fitting out our clinical
          areas as well as our office areas. We met with Apollo and were so
          impressed with their knowledge, professionalism and enthusiasm that we
          appointed them immediately. They had five and a half weeks to fit out
          two floors of office space plus clinical rooms… and they did! They
          were absolutely amazing. The work is second to none and the support
          and advice we received from them enabled us to move in on our
          scheduled date. We would definitely recommend them to anyone who is
          looking for a company who are first class in every way.”

          We would be happy to not only use your company again in the future but
          also to recommend you to others “Further to the recent completion of a
          number of refurbishment projects completed by Apollo Interiors, I
          think it would be appropriate, now that we have come to the end of our
          regular contact, to record for prosperity the views of the practices
          on your efforts. I think the most impressive part of our relationship
          was with regard to the timing and costs. The building work was
          completed within the agreed budget and handed over exactly on timWe
          would be happy to not only use your company again in the future but
          also to recommend you to otherse, as we had only a very small window
          of opportunity whereby, if the work had gone past the agreed finish
          date, then there would have been significant consequences to us as a
          business. All works were completed to a very high standard and we were
          satisfied with the project on all levels. .”

          forward to working with Apollo again.”
